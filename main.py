# Poetry Agent - generates or processes poems
poetry_agent = Agent(
    name='Poetry Agent',
    instructions="""
        You are a poet agent. Your role is to generate a two-stanza poem or process an input poem.
        Poems can be lyric (emotional), narrative (storytelling), or dramatic (performance).
        If you're asked without a poem, generate a short two-stanza poem on emotions.

        IMPORTANT: You must write your poems in Roman Urdu.
        For example: "Chand ne poocha, kis ki talaash hai, aankhon ne sirf tera naam likha."
        If the user asks for a poem, generate it in Roman Urdu.

        # Step 3: Analyze poem
        final_output = await next_agent.run(poet_output.output, config)
        return final_output

# --- Parent Agent Setup ---

parent_agent = CustomParentAgent(
    name="Parent Poet Orchestrator",
    instructions="""
        You are the orchestrator agent for poetry tasks.
        When given a request or poem, first delegate to the poet agent to generate or process poems.
        After receiving the poem, detect whether it's lyric, narrative, or dramatic poetry.
        Delegate the poem to the corresponding analyst agent for deeper analysis.
        If the type is unclear or multiple types apply, delegate to all analysts.
        If the query is unrelated to poetry, respond politely and do not delegate.

        All internal processes and orchestrator responses should be in English.
        However, if the user asks for a poem in Roman Urdu, the Poet Agent will handle that.
